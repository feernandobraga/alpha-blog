<h1 align="center">Listing all articles</h1>


<%# this will display the pagination %>
<div class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-5 mb-n4">
  <%= will_paginate %>
</div>


<%= render "article", obj: @articles %>

<%# I have removed the content of this page to a partial
    that is located at views > articles > _article.html.erb
    To pass the value from @articles to the variable obj
    I had to use the line above.
    I have done this so I can re-use the parcel with not only @articles
    but any other variable that I want, including instance variables from
    a controller that is not articles_controller.
    In fact, I have used the partial at views > users > show.html.erb
%>
